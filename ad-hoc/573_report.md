## Problem description

A snail moves in an axis every day. In the daytime, it moves in the positive direction for x; in the night, it moves in the negative direction for y; x are decreasing for every day until 0. Figure out in which day it passes Point X (its coordinate is more than X) or Point 0 (its coordinate is less than 0).

## Algorithm analysis

Simulate the process using loop. You can use a loop to simulate a day and a night; or a night and the next day. That is equivalent.
