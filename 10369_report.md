## Problem description

There is a graph containing P vertices each has a Cartesian coordinate. We can build two kinds of edges between them, one kind has no cost and at most P of them; the other has no limit of number but has a cost of exactly the distance between two vertices. We need to know the maximum distance of the second edge we built in the graph when we assign edges to make the graph connected with minimal cost.
